*  ># Documentation
*  > This directory structure represents a project with both frontend and backend components.

*  >In the root directory, there are configuration files like .gitignore, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and package.json. The .github directory contains files related to GitHub workflows, issue templates, and pull request templates. The .husky directory contains pre-commit and commit-msg hooks.
* >The "client" directory contains the frontend codebase with subdirectories for public assets and source files. The "src" directory within "client" contains components, Axios API configuration, and other frontend-related files.

* >The "server" directory contains the backend codebase, including an Auth module, database models, and an entry point (index.js) for the server.

* >Overall, the project seems to be a web application with a React-based frontend (client) and a Node.js-based backend (server), possibly utilizing MongoDB for data storage.
## Frontend

The "client" folder contains all the frontend-related code for the project. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

1. **package-lock.json** and **package.json**: These files manage the dependencies and scripts required for the frontend.

2. **README.md**: This file typically contains documentation or instructions specific to the frontend part of the project.

3. **tailwind.config.js**: This file is likely used to configure Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for customizing the project's styles.

4. **public**: This directory holds static assets like images and HTML files. It typically contains files like favicons, index.html, and robots.txt.

5. **src**: This directory contains the actual source code for the frontend. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

   - **App.css** and **index.css**: These are CSS files used to style the main app component and index file, respectively.
   - **App.jsx**: This is the main component of the React application, where other components are typically imported and rendered.
   - **index.js**: This file serves as the entry point for the React application, where the main App component is rendered into the DOM.
   
   Additionally, the "src" directory contains subdirectories for organizing different aspects of the frontend:

   - **Assets**: This directory likely holds various assets used in the application, such as images and logos.
   - **axios**: This directory may contain configuration files or utility functions related to Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
   - **components**: This directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the application. Each component typically has its own directory, which may include CSS files and other related assets.
   
     - Within the "components" directory, there are subdirectories for organizing different types of components, such as "Body" and "Form".

   - **lotties**: This directory may contain JSON files used with Lottie, a library for rendering After Effects animations in real-time.
   
   - **pages**: This directory contains React components that represent individual pages/routes of the application. Each component corresponds to a specific URL route and may contain JSX code for rendering the page's content.

* Overall, the "client" folder structure is organized to facilitate the development of a React-based frontend application, with separate directories for static assets, source code, and various components.
## Backend
The "server" folder contains all the backend-related code for the project. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

1. **.env**: This file typically stores environment variables, such as API keys or database connection strings, used by the backend application.

2. **Auth.js**: This file likely contains authentication-related logic, such as middleware functions or routes for user authentication and authorization.

3. **index.js**: This file serves as the entry point for the backend application. It may set up the server, define routes, and connect to the database.

4. **package-lock.json** and **package.json**: These files manage the dependencies and scripts required for the backend.

5. **models**: This directory likely contains database models, which define the structure and behavior of data stored in the database. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

   - **lsp.js** and **user.js**: These files likely define MongoDB models for storing data related to legal service providers (LSPs) and users, respectively.

* Overall, the "server" folder structure is organized to facilitate the development of a Node.js-based backend application, with separate files for defining routes, handling authentication, connecting to the database, and defining database models.
