#### Problem Statement 1286:

Incentives based Design for onboarding Legal Service Providers such as Advocates, Arbitrators, Mediators, Notaries, Document Writers, etc. on an e-Marketplace for extending Legal Services to Citizens in India.

#### Problem Statement Description:

In India, there exists a diverse array of legal service providers, including Advocates, Arbitrators, Mediators, Notaries, Document Writers, and more, who play pivotal roles in ensuring justice and legal compliance. However, the process of onboarding these essential legal service providers onto a unified platform has been traditionally cumbersome and inefficient. This disconnect often leaves citizens without easy access to the legal expertise they require.
